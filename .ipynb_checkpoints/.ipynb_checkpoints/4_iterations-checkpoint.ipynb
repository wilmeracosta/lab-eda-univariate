    "- `for` keyword: Starts the for loop.\n",
    "- `item`: Represents a variable that holds the current item in each iteration. \n",
    "    -  You can choose any valid variable name. It's a good practice to choose a meaningful variable name and one that hasn't been used before in your code to avoid overwriting its content.\n",
    "    - The variable (e.g., *item*) takes on the value of each element in the sequence or iterable, one at a time. This process continues until all the values in the sequence have been used, resulting in the statements being repeated as many times as there are elements in the sequence.\n",
    "- `in` operator: Specifies the sequence or collection to iterate over.\n",
    "- `sequence`: Refers to the list, tuple, string, range, or any other iterable object that you want to loop through.\n",
    "- `: colon`: is an essential symbol used in Python to indicate the start of a loop block. Following the colon, you should indent the subsequent lines of code consistently. \n",
    "- `Code to be executed`: \n",
    "    - **Indentation**: Although Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab automatically handle the indentation, it's important to ensure that the code is indented in the desired way for proper execution. Indentation plays a crucial role in Python, as it determines which lines of code are part of the loop and helps maintain the code's structure and readability.\n",
    "    - You can have as many lines of code as you need inside the for loop's block. These lines will be repeated for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "    - The statements inside the for loop's block will be repeated as many times as there are elements in the sequence. The block is executed once for each item in the sequence, following a specific order.\n"
